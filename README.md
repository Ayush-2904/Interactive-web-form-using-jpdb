**Additional information:**
Create an employee form as per the video link given at the end to store data in following columns of the relation "EmpData" in "EMP-DB" database.

 {id, name, salary, hra, da, deduction}

There will be three disabled control buttons [Save] [Change] [Reset] at the bottom of the form.

On page load or any control button click, an empty form will be displayed and the cursor will remain at 'Employee ID'. All other fields and buttons should be disabled at this time.

User will enter data in 'Employee ID' and

If {id} does NOT exist in the database, enable [Save] and [Reset] buttons and move the cursor to the next field and allow you to enter data in the form.
